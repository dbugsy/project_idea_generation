# Project idea generation workshop

* People come to the front and pitch an idea in 10 seconds (1 sentence).

* Try to favour "technical" projects that will involve writing some complex logic, rather than "API"ish projects that will be about jamming together a few existing libraries and APIs.

* Your coach will compile all the suggestions in a spreadsheet displayed on the projector.

* Your coach will send out the list of all the projects.  You'll pick your top three.

* Your coach will try to assign you to a team that will work on one of your preferred projects.
